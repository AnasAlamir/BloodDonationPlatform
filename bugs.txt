- if hospital deleted LastDateOfDonation is deleted as DonorDonationRequest is deleted due to cascade 
	(must LastDateOfDonation to DateOfDonation in DonorDonationRequest and LastDateOfDonation at donor)

- if hospital updated its area or request bloodType request still show at donor side (wrong)

2 login credentials 	


------------------------------------- not now at all
1-LastDateOfDonation to DateOfDonation in DonorDonationRequest 
2-GetOpenRequestsCountByHospitalIdAsync
  GetPendingRequestsCountByHospitalIdAsync
  i need when at least 1 donor accept to set request status to (in progress) 
- counts to be joined with GetAllActiveRequestsByHospitalIdAsync
3- hospital make many requests from same bloodType(??)
-  rename states Request to RequestStatus in donation Request (not urgent)
